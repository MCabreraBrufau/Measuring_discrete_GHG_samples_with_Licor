#Peaks to ppm 

# ---
# This script has been modified from https://github.com/MCabreraBrufau/Licor_N2O_scripts to identify and integrate peak not only for N2O but also for CO2 and CH4
# ---

#Description: this script uses integrated_injections files produced in the Raw_to_peaks_LicorN2O.R script and calculates ppm for each peak based on the calibration curve and volume injected. It outputs ppm data for each peak and for each sample
